## semantic elements 
Some changes that occured to help the semantic elements is the addtion of an id attribute to line 29, another change that occured was the adittion of alt tags.
Some examples of the code I changed are as followed
    ```md
    <section id="search=engine-optimization>
to line line 16
    ```md
## html structure
To improve the html structure some additions to the html include the addition of header, footer, sections, and a aside tag.
    ```md
    <header> <footer> <aside> <section>
    ```md
some code I added



## final notes 
To follow semantic structure some final notes are that the header is in sequential order. Another note is that there is a descriptive page website.
